== External Services ==

The BuddyClients Lite plugin connects to external services to protect forms from spam. These services are optional and disabled by default.

### Google reCAPTCHA Integration (Optional)

If enabled, Google reCAPTCHA is used to protect forms within the plugin from spam and abuse. When reCAPTCHA is active:

- The userâ€™s IP address and browser information are transmitted to Google for validation.
- Google may set cookies or track user interactions as outlined in their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).
- reCAPTCHA is used only for form security and does not collect additional user data beyond what is required for spam prevention.
- Users can enable or disable the reCAPTCHA integration through the plugin settings. When disabled, no data is transmitted to Google.
- The reCAPTCHA integration is disabled by default.

For more details, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://buddyclients.com/privacy).
