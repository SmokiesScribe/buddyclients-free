/*
 * BuddyClients Global JavaScript File
 *
 * @since 1.0.20
 * 
 * This file serves as a container for global JavaScript functionality for the BuddyClients plugin.
 * Inline JavaScript will be added dynamically to this file through WordPress hooks.
 * Currently, the file is empty, and any inline JavaScript will be enqueued directly in the footer or header via PHP functions.
 *
 * Future updates to this file will include any global JS logic for the BuddyClients plugin.
